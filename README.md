# What is mtgoappraiser?

mtgoappraiser is a fantastic GPL utility I've used for quickly aggregating multiple secondary market indicators together. I've been playing 'for free' ever since I wrote this tool. You can too.

At any point the 'owners' of 'secondary market information' may file an 'issue' with this repository pointing to specific 'rules' that may have been 'broken'. Upon receiving such an 'issue' I will rectify the code post-haste.

# Contributing?

To do list:

- [ ] Idiot-proof installation... not everyone can do the Java's, just maybe on a whiteboard...
- [ ] 'Agent' based mode that can run in the background as a daemon? for lazy people like myself
- [ ] More accesses to arbitrary secondary markets
- [ ] Implement OCR for 'unnamed secondary markets' that choose to obfuscate their pricing data with 'clever CSS hacks'
